## 🗝️ Demo Login Credentials

- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `123456`

> ⚠️ The login system is **non-restrictive for demonstration purposes**. Any valid credentials grant access, but the default above is recommended.


## 🗂️ Data Source

- The project uses **local JSON files** (`orders.json` and `customers.json`) located in the `/public` folder.
- This simulates an API for development and deployment on Vercel.
- The JSON data can be easily replaced with a real API by updating the `fetch()` calls in the components.
